Nineteen Hours
A poem by Seth Daugherty

Hello Yong
This is projext six
a rails app where gaming
nerds get their kicks

There's nothing here
not even half
Not enough to bother writing
feedback on my behalf

A lame excuse 
I do have. For ten
long days and ten long
nights I have been stricken
with the burden of family
Aunt Laura in my kitchen
on my couch and in my study

Laura is a talker
Uninterruptable
unending streams
inundate
my every waking moment

I have few scant
hours between 
work and sleep
She is quite keen
to theive them all

Fancies herself an astrologer
tell me of energy lines
dancing cosmic spheres
the sun's phantom sister star
determining our lives

I can't fucking take it anymore

And her daughter
her haughty daughter
is watching Inception
full volume
I said I had homework -
means nothing 
to an unemployed jewelry maker

I can't fucking take it anymore

Her plane leaves tomorrow
nineteen hours away
I get my house back
I get my time back
I get my sanity back

Project six on hold
for another nineteen hours
